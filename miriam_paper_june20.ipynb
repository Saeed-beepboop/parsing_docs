Um through CHILD-BRIGHT it’s something we’ve been doing for 20 plus years um so it's uh it's an area of comfort for us and it’s an area of expectation. Um so uh do you want me to talk about how this project has benefited specifically or more general?\n",

      "P2: OK so this particular project we had um a parent involved right from the get go. We actually did do something that we've never done before and that was um we put the parent as an investigator on the consent form. Um so I think that the benefit to that it keeps the parent-um participant, parent participation at the forefront.\n",

      "P2: Um the challenges of that, I’m sorry it’s all going to come in bits in pieces so you're going to have to use that. The initial challenge we had was that the research ethics board [uninintelligble] um CHILD-BRIGHT said ‘we cannot give this person a CHILD-BRIGHT email’ and I said ‘well you can't expect them to use their own email’\n",

      "I: Mhm \n",

So um you know, we can do our best to guess, through experience you have a pretty good idea what's needed um alternatively um having having them there sort of short circuits that and gives a much more relevant concept of what they want, how, what involvement they want, how much time they can devote, and what’s needed.\n",

And the parents are they are in their kids, in the system, in what it’s been like to go through life with a child with special needs and so that's something that unless you have that lived experience you really can’t get that. And so, I think by having these parents who are willing, they're very busy but, they're willing because they think it's important to have their voices heard and to speak on behalf of other parents, um I think that having an opportunity is really helpful for the study,\n",

      "P1: shape this study. I hope they don't feel overused because we we rely on them a lot and I know … especially um bounces things off them very regularly and they've been really great to respond even though they’re quite busy. So, I think that it’s been a really good experience for me. It's actually one of my first experiences working with a study with patient-partners and um yeah, it's been very very helpful and a new perspective that even when you think you have; you don’t always have.\n",

      "\n",
      "P2: There’s one really good example of that that happened last, about a year ago, this is a little over a year ago. And um one of the parent-partners was um, she was, I guess she was skulking around on the Face group book, Facebook group that had nothing to do with this study but it was a related study of um uh …testing \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: and um she was watching the parents have an exchange about how they felt lost and abandoned after they got results. So, um and this is not something I haven’t heard before. But it to hear it or have it [unintelligible] before, but to hear it so close to us, um made us really think ‘ok we really have to do with this’. And so that I think is probably the biggest thing that has, will come out of CHILD-BRIGHT, both in terms of participant-oriented research and in terms of KT. Um and that is um ability to provide support in the period surrounding results and the period way after because that’s something that that we know from our other research is still an issue you know 9-18 months and who knows how long after. People need to um have that support \n",

      "I: Right, right. \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: And I also think that that there’s not a lot of, I mean there’s social media, but to have an option for a family to have a voice and a direct connection with researchers, like it’s you know it’s very easy to go online and complain ‘oh we’re not getting good support and good follow-up’ but that doesn’t necessarily translate into better follow-up. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: In this case, because we had identified the patient-partner from the study, she was able to relay what she's hearing in the chatter, as far as what other families are going through and some of these are closed Facebook groups, we wouldn’t have access to. Um you know she’s able to bring it back to us and you know it’s something we were able to address in a small way, at least in our study and uh so I think that wouldn’t have been possible without being to close that loop and having a direct contact, um them to us and us to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: MHm, from what you’re saying i hear that there are already a lot of positives that have come out of patient-participation and engagement in the project. Um I want to turn now to some of the the challenges that you faced in um engaging partner, patient-partners and at the top of the conversation and there is already the mention of the consent form and wanting to put a patient-partner on the consent form and some complications and difficulty with that. So, I have that in mind as one potential challenge but uh what else have you found uh potentially challenging about uh collaborating with patient-partners in, through your research?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: I’ll start and then you can keep the intelligence going, how about that?  [laughs] \n",
      "\n",

I mean, we, …and I, have children even though mine have lived their lives now and adult, but all these issues but most of these issues were more predictable. We’re dealing with people that they never know whether their kid is going to be in hospital tomorrow, or you know you book something \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: and the child is sick or has a seizure. Or you know, you just so the complexity of their lives makes it extraordinarily difficult to um, to ask them to commit to something. And I wouldn’t want to ask people to commit the same way, you know you tell me to be here at 11:00 o'clock and so we are\n",
      "\n",

      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: And we’re good with that and I think you can understand that. One of the things that one of our parents actually took on is um the thing …referred to earlier, these are the experts \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yup \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: that we’re dealing with. You’re talking to me and I’m theoretically on work time so theoretically I’m being paid for this, if you were talking to one of our three parents-particpants um they are receiving an honorarium, an annual honorarium for being one of the parent-participants in our group. Um but it really doesn't compensate them adequately for the fact that they’re experts. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Um, if you hired an expert lawyer [laughs] at 5000$ a day or whatever [laughs]. um so I think that that um, we have to be very sensitive to that. And um one of the parents actually took CHILD-BRIGHT on [laughs] to be honest um about this\n",

      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: But we need to be much more, we need to acknowledge that these are experts. And we need to work with them, not as if they are, but because they are. Um [sigh], what else, fill in …while I think some more. \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: I love that last thing you said. That was so poignant. Not you know, I think because they’re experts. So, I think, and …, you know more of the details of this but was there some difficulty in getting travel remuneration for some of the um patient-partners? Was there something about that that was an obstacle? \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Um, I think CHILD-BRIGHT was actually really good the first meeting. Um they offered um uh childcare, travel, etc., etc., everything was great, um but the problem was that they had to cough up the money upfront \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: and they didn't have it\n",

      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: the parents had actually maxed out my credit card for the booking and actually then couldn’t use the credit card. It was really a real mess. And it took, I don’t know 4 months or something for CHILD-BRIGHT to settle. So, these are just things that you know, we have income, we’re doing the same thing you know, putting it on our credit card and there are probably some people for whom this is quite challenging too um but it's particularly challenging for parents. Um one of one of the previous studies that we have done in the … lab um was one that looked at the cost of caring for a child with a developmental um disability. And the what we call the lost opportunity cost is massive. Um that’s the cost that we don’t think of, the cost that usually it’s the Mom but it could be the Dad as well, has left a career, maybe a career that they’ve worked very hard to achieve, maybe maybe a career that that paid well, and maybe not. But most of them have lost a massive amount of income and we need to keep that in mind. We need to do everything we can to um make sure that participating in studies is not an additional burden \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: to them. And another thing that you're really interesting about the results of that study is that the income loss is not really proportional to the disability. So, um a child with a, who is let’s say high functioning level down syndrome who is able to go to school sort of and able to read at a grade 1 or 2 level, um the Mum has still be there for that child \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Just as they would be for a child who is profoundly disabled and wheelchair bound or doesn’t speak and so forth. So um we also need to keep in mind that there challenges for parents of children at all levels of um ability and disability, whatever word you want to use. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm, mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Sorry I was going somewhere with that, but I don’t remember where. Yeah, so anyway, we we need to acknowledge the fact that you have to pay upfront \n",

      "I: Right\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: So, um we functioned on telephone, um telephone meetings, I think the last time and this time before that which has been quite an intense period with them, and email so. [pause] Um anything else in the challenge department, …? \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: No, I think that's good, I think you that you know addressing flexibility and scheduling is a huge thing. So we always have to be mindful, bedtimes and quieter time for them and the unpredictability and so that’s you know sometimes from a researcher perspective that means that we have to be willing to have, you know, afterhours conversations, weekend conversations, um to work on their schedule. And and I think we’ve been very flexible and willing to do that because of the value that they’re able to add. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: I'm not sure if all research groups are able or willing to to incorporate that, so that may be a a challenge for some of them. You know now everything is outside of the hospital because of COVID, but um during hospital days um you know a lot of people work on that schedule and being flexible is not always possible from the workers perspective and it’s not feasible from a family's perspective to talk with during daytime hours so that must be a challenge. \n",

      "I: So, it sounds like some of the challenges that uh are barriers for uh patient-partner participation at the project level, so you know, very busy schedules for example uh also present as a barrier to wider network engagement, would that be accurate?\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Yes \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: I think so, and I think I think time, and focus are are important to acknowledge because if  we’re asking them very specific feedback related to our project which they have agreed to provide then you can’t, you can’t say ‘we want your feedback here, but that means you're also embedded into the organization as a whole’\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: And we’ve now exponentially required too much of your time. So, we have to be able to separate out those pieces and allow people to do one and not necessarily the other. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Um, I don’t know if that’s fair to say, …, but I feel like that’s that would be a barrier to getting any help at all.\n",

      "I: Mhm\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Yeah, I think that’s extremely well put. The focus, um they’ve agreed to this, to working on this project, they’re passionate about that\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Um, they know us, they have expectations as to what’s going to happen. Um, then things keep coming in from left field and and it always this is always a um feeling I think of some obligations even though it says ‘oh you don’t have to do it’\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: So\n",

      "I: Mhm\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: I don’t know if that’s fair to say or if this is an appropriate venue but my inbox is full and and you know for 7 emails from CHILD-BIRGHT, I love, I love the organization we’re nothing but grateful for the support they’ve given the study. The study is just incredible, the families are amazing and like and none of this would be possible without them. But to parse our time, um by all of the little sub-studies that we’re asked to participate in\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: There’s a feeling of obligation, there’s a feeling of gratefulness, there’s a feeling of wanting to give back and there an overwhelming feeling of guilt for not being able to keep up with [laughs] with all these things. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: And so I think if there can be some sort of way of prioritizing needs, or prioritizing asks, um you know without the fear of repercussions or the fear of you know, of the study being given up last month because we’re not participating as much or engaging with CHILD-BRIGHT as much as we um \n",

      "\n",
      "P2: Yes, I mean I agree that I feel the same way. Even though I enjoy talking to you [laughs], I should be getting on with something else. Um you know the week of my salary comes out of here, and it you know consumes 3 days/week of my time [laughs]\n",

Like we're happy to talk together today in that like cuts our time a little bit but um like … is great to answer the surveys and things like that. And you know, we sometimes take turns; ‘are you gonna, able to do this one? I could do this one’\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: But I’m not sure all studies have more than one person able to engage in that way and that it isn’t a bit draw on one person’s time. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: My guess is that there is probably, is because CHILD-BRIGHT is sort of start [unintelligble] really, let’s be honest. And people were hired like ‘oh let’s do this, we should do that’\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: I think ,a nd which is normal and common in a big project, but it does result in some challenges, yeah. And I think, to be honest, the lack of compensation for this um is huge. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: And I'm not, I would I wouldn't ask for money myself but I sure would like some more money for the CHILD-BRIGHT project,\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Because minutes we spend on this is less minutes we can spend on parents. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm, mhm. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Yeah \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Thank you for sharing that point. I think it's an important one and it's not the first time that I've heard something similar uh in these interviews so I'm glad that you raised it.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Um if uh, if I can ask one more question just in terms of the success of patient-oriented research as a model, as a way of doing research. Um in what ways, if any, have you seen that model of research be successful at uh the project level? And big, big or small ways so far, as you’ve been conducting this project?\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Uh, we’ve actually been able to develop, and … can speak more to this, but the incredible students that we’ve had, have been able to listen to the parent’s feedback, take very specific feedback and turn it into resources for families. So, um one of the initial pieces of feedback that we heard was that, … testing takes a long time, it’s like going through an encyclopedia and looking for a period missing, or a spelling mistake, or D for an A.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: So, it takes us a long time. So, families will give a blood sample, and then fall into the black hole of the study and not know where they’re at, when there is also the coming in. You know, we try to mitigate that, we try to set expectations at the start but it's very common to just wonder along the way, ‘did they forget about me?’ And so that was something that one of our patient-partners had brought up early on and one of our students developed kind of like a fed-ex timeline where they were able to um, at different points during the study, just send out even an automated email to say ‘now your DNA is here and this is what’s happening’, ‘now this is what’s happening with the study’, um and so people just get that little reminder of um. And so some families say ‘Oh I forgot I was in this study’ \n",
      "\n",
      "I: [laughs]\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: And other families have been chewing their fingernails saying ‘when am I going to get some information?’ So, either way I think it’s a nice way to stay in touch with um a limited draw on our time but it really lets patients and families know that we’re, that we’re keeping up, that they’re still on our radar. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: That’s fantastic. \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: So that yeah, and that’s something that came about directly because of one of the parent comments, uh about not knowing where they were. And so we’re, especially … , is very good at, not just empathetic listening and responding\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: But taking action. So, taking that information that we're getting and turning it into a useful tool and uh something that families can engage with. And then the other uh big, huge one is our most recent um and this is off the comment of that patient-participant, a parent-participant who said that um the chatter was, the lack of support around receiving result, and so we’ve uh been able to create a … it um specific to the study in that it talks about what testing was done in the study. It’s uh personalized for the families to talk about what their results are. Um it gives resources for follow up, and it’s all in one place\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: So, and it’s electronic or it can be paper. It’s a resource that they can hand to other family members if they say ‘I didn’t totally understand what the … counsellor told me, but they gave me this …. Maybe you can make more better or maybe you can contact her?’ or you know here’s a bit of a written resource that they can go back to again and again\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: And so those, and so that actually we're hoping to roll that out into the wider world even outside of the … study and outside of research even because the … as a clinical tool is getting more and more common.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Um and yet it’s something that’s not really well understood and interpreting the results is not easy. Um what does a negative result mean, what does an uncertain result mean?\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Um and so having all of that right there in one place, in a nice lay-patient friendly way, with diagrams and um resources is something we were able to put together because of collected feedback from the patient partners. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Let me get my cord, I'll be right back. … you’re up. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: [laughs]\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: And so relating to that, we would be, our parent-participants uh were, we have we been actually written several grants, but finally we were successful in getting a …… grant, 1000$ that enabled us to um meet a couple of the goals for expanding that research … and what we’re doing um is first of all, we’re translating it. And we’re translating it to, we said we wanted to translate it into four languages, the …uh reviewers said start with 1. So, we can’t get it compromised by starting it soon. But the common languages for which we needed interpretation, and then we’re also, we are nearly through making a generic version um, which will be useful in the clinic. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: And so, it just removes the research specific aspect and adds some um different tools that clinicians would use in the clinic. And the clinicians have to have seen it and absolutely they love it, they think it’s the best and the parents love it. I mean we got an evaluation component in that, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: So that’s impact from the network as a whole, but nothing to do with you know originally managed project but it’s been us and probably going to be the most useful KT thing that comes out of this project is my guess\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: unless the students and the parents think of something else for next year. But I don’t, our project is due to end um December 31st. Um, which is obviously not your problem. But we actually don’t have, we have a problem with COVID.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhh, yeah. \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: [laughs] Like everybody else\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: So, we really need sort of a 6-month extension, but anyway. That’s not your problem, I guess.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah, unfortunately but I will keep my fingers crossed at the very least\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Yeah, you know what I think. I’m thinking of all that money that was saved by not running the in-person conference. [unintelligible] waited months for this\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Although the conference will happen, it has been delayed but uh they're looking at other dates. So, um I'm not sure exactly when that's going to happen but it will.\n",
      "\n",
      "P2: Well if it’s this time next year we’re out, we’re gone. \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah, absolutely \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: [laughs]. We run out of money December 31st if nothing else happens.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah \n",
      "\n",
      "P2: And then when the second wave comes, you know um, you probably know this, I’m sure it’s the same at McGill. In fact, I know it’s the same at McGill at least for the first term. But at … they now have decided that they’re putting both term 1 and 2 online\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm, mhm. I haven’t heard word from McGill for the winter but definitely for the fall all, I think all the universities in Montreal are going to be online only which is the right choice. Yeah.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "I: My background, my background is in journalism and history. So um, yes, I have a communications background which is how I wound up in this role at CHILD-BRIGHT but uh you know well I had a bit of a research background it was in the humanities and not in healthcare. So um this has been a really interesting learning curve for me in a good way.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: Yeah that's fun \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Yeah, and I mean on a personal note it's fun to be able to to meet members like the two of you who I have not had the occasion to meet in person and would have hoped to at let's say the conference in March but of course that didn't happen. So, um this is a very very personal selfish note but it is a real pleasure to hear from from the two of you about some of the the issues, the benefits, and also some of the challenges when it comes to true meaningful patient engagement, right.\n",
      "\n",
      "P: Mhm, yeah \n",

      "P1: And I guess the hope is part of your role that this will all translate into meaningful outcome.\n",
      "\n",
      "I: Exactly, that’s exactly it, right. Um I think uh it will be important in terms of publishing uh in in uh you know the academic world. But the ultimate goal within CHILD-BRIGHT is to just take exactly what we're learning from this this study and re implementing that. So that's why I think it's really important like I said thank you and I'll say thank you again for some of the feedback that you've given because I think it's really important that it's heard in this form.\n",
      "\n",
      "P1: But I, I also think, like people like …, are able, and hopefully people like you and other people at CHILD-BRIGHT instead of just synthesizing all the talk that we’ve been able to go through today \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",

      "\n",
      "P1: So, there’s just so many papers out there saying this is the discourse, this is the analysis, this is the uh you know next stage we need more research. And I just, that sort of thing it just grates on me a little bit because I feel there must be a more concrete way to make solid changes and that that’s what we’ve been able to see in our study and … has been the one who made that happen. It’s to take the key information and translate into a concrete tool \n",
      "\n",
      "I: Mhm \n",

      "I: Yeah well put and um that’s you know when we, we asked for when we were putting together this interview guide we've made sure to put in a question about um specific strategies and supports that um you know project members have been using, committee members have been using, and what can be helpful in the future to address some of those challenges. Because like you say the point is to to draw those concrete actions and those concrete strategies out of of these interviews so um that's that's absolutely on the radar and it's absolutely a goal, so, yeah. \n",
